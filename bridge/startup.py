"""Auto-start the bridge when UEFN opens your project.

Place this file as:  <YourProject>/Content/Python/init_unreal.py

UEFN automatically runs any init_unreal.py found in its Python paths on
editor startup.  This stub imports the bridge and starts the HTTP server.

Prerequisites:
    Copy the bridge/ folder into the same Content/Python/ directory so that
    `import bridge.server` resolves correctly.
